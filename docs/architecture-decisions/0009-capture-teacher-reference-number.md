# 9. Capture a Teacher Reference Number to validate a claimant’s qualifications

Date: 2019-06-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A claimant’s eligibility is, in part, determined by their qualifications. We
want to be able to validate that a claimant’s qualifications match those of the
eligibility criteria.

## Decision

To aid DfE in the process of validating a claimant’s qualifications, we will
collect the claimant's 'Teacher Reference Number' or TRN.

With the TRN, DfE can use the Database of Qualified Teachers
([DQT](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login)) to validate
a claimant’s qualifications.

## Consequences

A claimant’s TRN may be information they do not have readily to hand, so may
increase the difficulty and time needed for them to complete a claim
application.
