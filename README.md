# Claim Additional Payments for Teaching

## Documentation

Most documentation for the service can be found on the [project's confluence
wiki](https://dfedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TP). Some app-specific
technical documentation can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.

### ADRs

Architecture decision records can be found in the
[architecture-decisions](docs/architecture-decisions) directory.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.2
- PostgreSQL
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

You will also need Java 11 or a long term supported version of Java 8 installed
for the Verify Service Provider to run. We recommend [OpenJDK][openjdk].

## Setting up the app in development

1. In order to integrate with DfE Sign-in's Open ID Connect service we are
   required to communicate over https in development. Create a self-signed
   development certificate.
   - Run `openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt`
   - Open Keychain Access on your Mac and go to the Certificates category in
     your System keychain. Once there, import the `localhost.crt`
     `File > Import Items`. Double click the imported certificate and change the
     “When using this certificate:” dropdown to `Always Trust` in the Trust
     section.
2. Run `bundle install` and `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `bundle exec rails db:setup` to set up the database development
4. Run `bundle exec foreman start` to launch the app on https://localhost:3000

### DfE Sign In credentials

By default in development OmniAuth will run in test mode. This means that you
don't need to authenticate with DfE Sign In. If you need to run development with
integration with DfE Sign In, you need to provide the relevant environment
variables.

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
DFE_SIGN_IN_ISSUER=https://pp-oidc.signin.education.gov.uk:443
DFE_SIGN_IN_REDIRECT_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000
DFE_SIGN_IN_IDENTIFIER=<paste identifier>
DFE_SIGN_IN_SECRET=<paste secret>
GOVUK_VERIFY_ENABLED=1
GOVUK_VERIFY_VSP_HOST=http://localhost:50300
```

The identifier and secret are stored in Heroku.

### GOV.UK Notify

We use Notify to send emails however it is turned off by default in development.
If you want to test Notify in development you will need an API key and template
ID and add them to your `.env`. Make sure you use a 'test' or 'team' API key
only.

```
NOTIFY_API_KEY=<paste api key>
NOTIFY_TEMPLATE_ID=d72e2ff9-b228-4f16-9099-fd9d411c0334
```

### GOV.UK Verify

The service uses GOV.UK Verify to verify the identity of teachers that are
claiming. See [docs/govuk-verify](/docs/govuk-verify.md) for details on this,
including how to run the verify dependencies locally.

### Running `CronJob`s

Recurring jobs are scheduled by the `db:schedule_jobs` rake task. This task
normally runs as part of `db:migrate` or `db:schema:load`, but is disabled in
development environments. To schedule them during development, run:

```
rake db:schedule_jobs
```

## Running specs, brakeman, and code linting

```
bundle exec rake
```

To run the feature specs you will need Chrome installed.

### Code linting rules

Code linting is performed using:

- [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) for Ruby
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for everything else

### N+1 query detection

[Bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet) runs around each spec. If it detects an N+1 query it will raise an
exception and the tests will fail.

## Production

### Building the Docker container

Make sure you build the image with the target of `web` to ensure that only
production assets are added.

```
docker build --target web .
```

## Service architecture

The service architecture is currently defined and [on confluence](https://dfedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TP/pages/1049559041/Service+Architecture).

## Access

Staging is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication. The username and password
are pinned in the _dfe-teacher-payments_ slack channel or can be found
in the _Config Vars_ in Heroku.
