          performance:
            question: "Are you subject to any formal performance measures as a result of continuous poor teaching standards?"
            hint:
              This will be as a result of your underperformance as a teacher over a period of time. It could put your
              employment at the further education (FE) provider at risk and is something we may check with them as it
              will affect your eligibility.
          disciplinary:
            question: 'Are you currently subject to disciplinary action?'
            hint:
              This is more serious than performance measures and could be because of misconduct. It is something we may
              check with your FE provider as it will affect your eligibility.
        errors:
          performance:
            inclusion: "Select yes if any performance measures have been started against you"
