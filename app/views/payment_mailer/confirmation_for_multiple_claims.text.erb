The payment you claim for is the Net Payment (after Income Tax and NI deductions). The student loan deduction is calculated from your Gross Pay (before Income Tax and NI deductions are taken). We are following HMRC guidance in treating this retention payment, for the purpose of employee deductions, as weekly pay.

The amount you receive is <%= number_to_currency(@payment.net_pay) %>. As this payment is treated as pay, a deduction has been automatically made from the <%= number_to_currency(@payment.award_amount) %> to contribute towards repaying your student loan.

You may also see ‘Teaching payments DfE retention scheme’ listed as the secondary employer that made this payment.

^ This email should be treated as a payslip, and as such kept for your own records in line with HMRC recommendations (22 months after the financial year the payment relates to). The payment breakdown details will not appear on your P60, and cannot be reissued.
