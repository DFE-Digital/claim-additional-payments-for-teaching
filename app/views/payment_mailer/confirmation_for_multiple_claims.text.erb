# Breakdown of payment

<% if @payment.student_loan_repayment&.nonzero? || @payment.postgraduate_loan_repayment&.nonzero? %>
This payment is treated as pay and is therefore subject to a student loan contribution, if applicable.

<% @payment.claims.each do |claim| %>
* <%= I18n.t("#{claim.policy.locale_key}.claim_amount_description") %>: <%= number_to_currency(claim.award_amount) %>
<% end %>
* Amount you applied for: <%= number_to_currency(@payment.award_amount) %>
<% if @payment.student_loan_repayment&.nonzero? %>* Student loan contribution: <%= number_to_currency(@payment.student_loan_repayment) %>
You told us you’re currently repaying a student loan. This amount is deducted from your payment and goes towards repaying your loan.
<% end %><% if @payment.postgraduate_loan_repayment&.nonzero? %>* Postgraduate Master’s or PhD loan contribution: <%= number_to_currency(@payment.postgraduate_loan_repayment) %>
You told us you’re currently repaying a Postgraduate Master’s Loan or Postgraduate Doctoral Loan. This amount is deducted from your payment and goes towards repaying your loan.
