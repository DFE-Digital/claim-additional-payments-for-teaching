Dear <%= @display_name %>,

You will receive <%=number_to_currency(@payment.net_pay) %> on <%= @payment_date.to_fs(:custom_ordinal) %>.

# Breakdown of payment

This payment is treated as pay and is therefore subject to a student loan contribution, if applicable.

<% breakdown_of_payment_bullets(@payment).each do |bullet| %>
* <%= bullet %>
<% end %>

Your payment is also subject to Income Tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions, which we pay to HMRC on your behalf. This does not affect the amount you receive and we only share this with you in case you need the information in the future.

* Income Tax: <%= number_to_currency(@payment.tax) %>
* Employee NI: <%= number_to_currency(@payment.national_insurance) %>
* Gross amount paid by us: <%= number_to_currency(@payment.gross_pay) %>

The Gross amount is comprised of the payment you receive, your student loan contribution, and the Income Tax and Employee NI set out above. You may see this figure on any tax statements or other correspondence relating to taxable pay.

The payment will come from the Department for Education.

This email should be treated as a payslip, and kept for your own records in line with HMRC recommendations (22 months after the financial year the payment relates to). The payment breakdown details will not appear on your P60, and cannot be reissued.
