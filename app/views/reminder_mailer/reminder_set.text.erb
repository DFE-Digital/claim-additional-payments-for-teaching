Dear <%= @reminder.full_name %>,

We will send you a reminder in September <%= @reminder.send_year %>.

After receiving the reminder email, you will have five months to complete an application. If any of your employment circumstances change it might affect your eligibility.

It is your responsibility to apply for an early-career payment. We will need to assess your eligibility each time you apply otherwise you will not get a payment. The Department for Education cannot issue payments unless you apply for one.

If you have any issues, email us at: <%= support_email_address("early-career-payments") %> with your unique reference and your query.
