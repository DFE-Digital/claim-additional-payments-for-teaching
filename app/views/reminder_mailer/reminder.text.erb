Dear <%= @reminder.full_name %>,

The <%= @year %> early-career payment window is now open. You will have five months from the date of this email to apply.

It is your responsibility to apply for an early-career payment. The Department for Education cannot issue payments unless you apply for one.

Apply for an early-career payment.

If you have any issues, email us at: <%= support_email_address("early-career-payments") %> with your unique reference and your query.
