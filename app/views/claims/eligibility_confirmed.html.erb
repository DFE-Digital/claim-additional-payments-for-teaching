    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">You are eligible to claim back student loan repayments</h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">Based on your answers, you can claim back the student loan repayments you made between 6 April 2018 and 5 April 2019.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">So we can pay you, we need to check your identity using GOV.UK Verify – our secure way to prove who you are online.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you do not have an account already, you’ll have to sign up for one. This usually takes around 15 minutes. You'll need a passport or photocard driving licence and a debit or credit card.</p>
