  Compliance status
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This website is partially compliant with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
  Guidelines) version 2.2 AA standard, due to the following non-compliances
  (and/or) the following exemptions.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Non-accessible content
</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The content is non-accessible for the following reason(s):
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
  Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Whilst navigating with iOS VoiceOver enabled, sometimes when navigating
  between pages, the focus may not be on an element on the page and may require
  the page to be interacted with before being swiped through. This fails WCAG
  2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value. This issue is believed to be
  an issue with iOS VoiceOver and is unable to be fixed.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
  Disproportionate burden
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
  We have determined that there is disproportionate burden to meet all the
  requirements for the following reasons:
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Making improvements would exceed budget for the year and leave the department
  unable to do other work - and would not significantly improve things for
  disabled users.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
  The content is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
  PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 are out of scope of
  the regulations.

  accessibility as we update our service.
