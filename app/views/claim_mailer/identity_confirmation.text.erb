Dear <%= @display_name %>,

In order to process your claim <%= @claim_description %> (<%= @claim.reference %>) we need to be able to identify your teacher record. To do this we need your correct teacher reference number and National Insurance number.

We see that when you submitted your claim you provided the teacher reference number: <%= @claim.teacher_reference_number %> and National Insurance number: <%= @claim.national_insurance_number %>.

After further investigation, we believe this information is incorrect.

Please reply to this email to provide us with your correct teacher reference and National Insurance number.

Alternatively, if you believe the information provided is correct, please let us know.
