      This is because, based on your answers, you will be able to apply for an early-career
      payment at each of these times.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      After receiving each reminder email, you will have five months to complete an
      application. If any of your employment circumstances change it might affect your
      eligibility.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      It is your responsibility to apply for the payment. The Department for Education
      cannot issue payments unless you apply for one.
