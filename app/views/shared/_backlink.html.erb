  # now that we're redirecting away from `/claim`.
  #
  # Also this hides a subtle bug: `current-school` is a first step
  # for ECP/LUP but is the second step for Maths & Physics and is the
  # fifth step for Student Loans. This means those steps would
  # erroneously lose their back links too.
  #
  # Backlinks are broken on the Safari Web browser anyway so
  # need to be revisited.
