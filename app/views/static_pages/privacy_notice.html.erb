      Why our use of your personal data is lawful
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one or more conditions in the data
      protection legislation.  For the purpose of ‘<%= t("service_name") %>‘, the Department processes your
      data where it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
      official authority (Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation).

      Who we will make your personal data available to
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners
      (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need
      to share your personal data for specific purposes).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with data
      protection legislation.
