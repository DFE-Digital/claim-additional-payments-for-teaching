      In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one or more conditions in the data protection legislation.  
      For the purpose of ‘<%= policy_service_name(current_policy_routing_name) %>‘, the Department processes your data where it is necessary 
      for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority (Article 6(1)(e) of the

      Who we will make your personal data available to
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners 
      (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need 
      to share your personal data for specific purposes). As part of the claims process, you will be required to verify 
      your identity through GOV.UK Verify.  We may check information in your application with the school you are currently 
      employed to teach at, the Department for Education's database of qualified teachers and the Teacher Pension Service.  
      Your information is also shared with HMRC for the purposes of processing the claim for student loan repayment.  
      The information we share is explained to you at each stage in the application process.
