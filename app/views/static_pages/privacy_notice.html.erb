      Why our use of your personal data is lawful
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one or more conditions in the data
      protection legislation.  For the purpose of ‘<%= policy_service_name(current_policy_routing_name) %>‘, the Department processes your
      data where it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
      official authority (Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation).
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Who we will make your personal data available to
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners
      (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need
      to share your personal data for specific purposes).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with data
      protection legislation.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">

      <li>
        to enable users to use the service and receive updates
      </li>
      <li>
        for security purposes: collecting the IP addresses of people visiting ‘<%= policy_service_name(current_policy_routing_name) %>’
        (for example, if we were receiving continuous direct denial of service attacks from an IP address then we could block it)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      How we access your personal data
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      To process your claim we will compare the information you have provided with records kept on the Teachers
      Pension Scheme and the Database of Qualified Teachers. This is so we can validate your claim.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      How long we will keep your personal data
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Neither DfE nor its delivery partners will keep your personal data longer than we need it for the purpose(s) of
      research, security and/or delivery of the service. Your data will be deleted when DfE and its delivery partners no
      longer need it for these purposes.
