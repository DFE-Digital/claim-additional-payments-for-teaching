      Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to
      the non-compliances listed below.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        page titles do not follow accessibility guidelines
      </li>
      <li>
        some error messages are inconsistently formatted
      </li>
      <li>
        auto complete for address may not function correctly
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Page titles are not clear and descriptive. They all have the same content.  This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success
      criterion 2.4.2 (page titled).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We plan to amend the page titles by December 2020. When we create new pages we will be sure to use descriptive
      page titles.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some error messages are inconsistently formatted. There is a list of all errors at the top of each page, but some
      pages to not provide guidance on how to resolve the error next to the relevant input.  This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1
      success criterion 3.3.3 (error suggestion).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We plan to amend the error messages by December 2020. When we create new pages we will make sure to use
      consistently formatted error messages.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some pages return errors when parsed through a html validator. Although the pages should display correctly they
      may have invalid html. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.1 (parsing).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We plan to amend the pages to ensure they are valid html by December 2020. When we create new pages we will make
      sure they validate.
