# frozen_string_literal: true

# Represents the pages in the claim process.
#
# Depending on the state of `claim`,  the sequence of slugs will change,
# filtering out pages that are not relevant. For example, the sequence for a
# claim that states it is still employed at the same school as the
# `claim_school` will skip the `current-school` page as `current_school` is
# inferred to be the same as `claim_school.
