    # Returns the AcademicYear during or after which teachers must have completed

    # a claim. Anyone qualifying before this academic year should not be able to

    #
    # Teachers that qualified after 2013 are eligible to claim back student loans
    # repayments for 10 years. Their first claim will be made in the subsequent
    # year because they are retrospectively claiming *back* repayments made during
    # the *financial year*. So for example if you qualify in 2021/2022, you are
    # eligible to claim back student loan repayments you make in the 2021/2022
    # "financial year", which ends April 2022, and the claim for that period can
    # be made from the start of the 2022/2023 "academic year".
    #
    # So to give concrete examples, teachers qualifying in 2013/2014 can make
    # claims up to 2024/2025, and a teacher qualifying in 2014/2015 can make
    # claims up to 2025/2026 and so on.
