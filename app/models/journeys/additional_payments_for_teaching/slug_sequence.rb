    # Determines the slugs that make up the claim process for a Early-Career Payments
    # claim. Based on the existing answers on the claim, the sequence of slugs
    # will change. For example, if the claimant has said they are not a supply teacher
    # then they will not answer the two questions that are associated with supply
    # teaching. 'entire-term-contract' and 'employed-directly' will not be part of the sequence.
    #
    # Note that the sequence is recalculated on each call to `slugs` so that it
    # accounts for any changes that may have been made to the claim and always
    # reflects the sequence based on the claim's current state.
    # There are 4 distinct phases of the claimant journey
