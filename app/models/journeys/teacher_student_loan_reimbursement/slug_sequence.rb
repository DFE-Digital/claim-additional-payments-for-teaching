    # Determines the slugs that make up the claim process for a Student Loans
    # claim. Based on the existing answers on the claim, the sequence of slugs
    # will change. For example, if the claimant has said they are not paying off a
    # student loan, the questions to determine their loan plan will not be part of
    # the sequence.
    #
    # Note that the sequence is recalculated on each call to `slugs` so that it
    # accounts for any changes that may have been made to the claim and always
    # reflects the sequence based on the claim's current state.
