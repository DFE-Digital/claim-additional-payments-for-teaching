  # This is concerned with the award information from the spreadsheet, which will
  # contain the pre-computed amount, thereby we don't need to check the EIA or pupil premium
  # status ourselves.
  #
  # The information from the spreadsheet could be stored in the existing `School` table,
  # or a `School` could have an optional relationship to an award amount table.
  #
  # The only reason for this class to change is regarding how the monetary amount
  # is stored.

    # The spreadsheet contains the pre-computed amount as a currency string
    # like "Â£2,000.00" or "No payment" and is attached to

    # We'll need a job to perform the initial database storage of this data.
