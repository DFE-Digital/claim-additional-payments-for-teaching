module EarlyCareerPayments
  # Determines the slugs that make up the claim process for a Early-Career Payments
  # claim. Based on the existing answers on the claim, the sequence of slugs
  # will change. For example, if the claimant has said they are not a supply teacher
  # then they will not answer the two questions that are associated with supply
  # teaching. 'entire-term-contract' and 'employed-directly'will not be part of the sequence.
  #
  # Note that the sequence is recalculated on each call to `slugs` so that it
  # accounts for any changes that may have been made to the claim and always
  # reflects the sequence based on the claim's current state.
  # There are 4 distinct phases of the claimant journey
