# Used to model an academic year, which is normally displayed in the format
# "YYYY/YYYY". Supports comparison and basic arithmetic operations.
#
# Can be initialised both with a single start year, or the academic year as a
# string. For example:
#
#   AcademicYear.new(2014).to_s        #=> "2014/2015"
#   AcademicYear.new("2014/2015").to_s #=> "2014/2015"
#
# It also supports being displayed in a user-friendly format:
#
#   AcademicYear.new("2014/2015").to_s(:long) #=> "2014 to 2015"
